## Description: 

Main: This project allows you to create a professional ReadMe for a new project. 

Using this generator, you will open Terminal and type node index.js. There will be a list of questions that will ask you to answer. 

Questions include: 

* What is the title of your project? 
* Write a Description of the project
* What command should be run to install dependencies? 
* What does the user need to know about using the repo? 
* What does the user need to know about contributing to the repo? 
* What command should be run to run tests? 
* What kind of license should your project have?
* What is your GitHub username? 
* What is your email address?

Once these questions are then answered, it will then generate a readme with all the information you have answered.
